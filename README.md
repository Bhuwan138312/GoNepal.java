# GoNepal.java
GoNepal is a JavaFX-based tourism management app featuring destination browsing, guide booking, reports, and activity logs. It includes a dedicated admin panel for managing places, users, and system data. Built as my first Java project, it offers a clean UI and smooth navigation for a realistic tourism experience.
